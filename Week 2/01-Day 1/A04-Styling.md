### **Directions**

#### **Page Requirements (MVP)**

1. **Link the CSS File**:  
   - Ensure the `styles.css` file is correctly linked to your HTML file.  

2. **Font Styling**:  
   - Change the font color of the `<h1>` element (the title of your page).  
   - Set the font size of all `<p>` elements to **16px**.  

3. **Spacing (Margin and Padding)**:  
   - Wrap your about me section up to education sections in a `<main>` container.  Add **24px padding** inside the `<main>` container for better spacing around the content.  
   - Set **24px 0 margin** outside the `<h1>` to provide space between it and surrounding elements.  
   - Add **12px padding** to the `<footer>` and set a **24px top margin** to create space between the footer and content above.
   - Add **24px margin** to the `<nav>` container to create space.
   - Set the **padding** of `<li>` elements to **8px** for better spacing.
   - Set the margins of `<section>` elements to **24px 0** with a padding of **16px** for better spacing.
   - Set the **margin** of `<img>` elements to **16px 0**.


4. **Background Colors**:  
   - Set the background color of the `<body>` to **rgb(240, 235, 235)** for a soft, light background.  
   - Change the background color of the `<main>` section (e.g., a light gray or any color that complements the portfolio).
   - Change the background color of the `<nav>` and `<section>` section.
   - Set the background color of the `<footer>` to **black** and its text color to **white** for contrast.

5. **Width, Height, and Borders**:  
   - Resize the portfolio **image** to **200px** while maintaining the aspect ratio.  
   - Add a **border** around the `<main>` container and set its **width to auto**.
   - Add a **border** around the image and set its **border-width** to **2px**. 
   - Adjust the footerâ€™s **height** and add a **gray border** around it.

#### **Stretch Requirements**

1. **Advanced Border Styling**:  
   - Add **rounded corners** (16px radius) to the `<main>` container, sections, footer, and image.  
   - Apply a **shadow effect** to the `<main>` container, sections, and the image for depth.

2. **Custom Fonts**:  
   - Use a **Google Font** (e.g., "Roboto" or "Open Sans") for all text.

   Save your HTML file as `lastname_firstname_portfolio.html` and your CSS file as `styles.css`.  
2. Place both files in a folder named `Lastname_Firstname_Portfolio_Styling` (e.g., `doe_john_portfolio_styling`).
