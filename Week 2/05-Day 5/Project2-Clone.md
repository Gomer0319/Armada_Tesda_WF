### **Instructions**

1. **Analyze the Screenshot**  
   - Study the layout and break it into sections (e.g., header, navigation, hero section, content, and footer).  
   - Identify the key components (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing).  

2. **Set Up the Project**  
   - Create a folder named `lastname_firstname_screenshotclone`.  
   - Inside the folder, create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file.  
   - Link the CSS file to your HTML.  

3. **Structure the Content**  
   - Use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.  
   - Add placeholder text or dummy content if necessary (e.g., `Lorem Ipsum` for text).  

4. **Style the Page**  
   - Use CSS to replicate the layout, colors, and spacing.  
   - Apply the **Box Model** for padding, margins, and borders.  
   - Use **Flexbox** or CSS Grid for alignment and positioning.  

5. **Search for Assets**  
   - Look for similar images and icons used in the design.  
   - Use free resources like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), or [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).  

6. **Test and Adjust**  
   - Check your design on different screen sizes (if applicable).  
   - Make adjustments to get the layout as close as possible to the screenshot.
