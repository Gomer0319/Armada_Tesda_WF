### **Assignment 5: Enhancing Your Personal Portfolio with Layout and Interactivity**

In this assignment, you will enhance your **Personal Portfolio** by focusing on layout and interactivity. You will structure your sections using the CSS box model, apply Flexbox for responsive design, and implement interactivity through pseudo-classes such as `:hover` and `:focus`. This will improve the overall user experience and ensure your portfolio looks polished.

#### **Estimated Time to Completion:** 3-5 hours  
#### **Level of Complexity:** Intermediate

### **Instructions**

1. **Base Assignment**: Use the **Personal Portfolio** you created in **Assignment 3** and **4** as your base for this layout and interactivity assignment.
2. **Create or Update CSS File**: Update the `styles.css` file from previous assignments or create a new one if needed.
3. **Apply Layout Enhancements**: Use the box model, Flexbox, and positioning techniques to organize the sections effectively.
4. **Enhance Interactivity**: Use pseudo-classes to create a more interactive and accessible user experience.
5. Save both files in a folder named `Lastname_Firstname_Portfolio_Enhancement` (e.g., `doe_john_portfolio_enhancement`).

### **Evaluation Criteria & Learning Objectives**

By completing this assignment, trainees will be able to:

- **Improve Portfolio Layout Using CSS Techniques**
  - Structure sections using the box model (margin, padding, border, width, height).
  - Apply display properties (block, inline-block, flex) to organize content.
  - Use positioning techniques (relative, absolute, fixed, sticky) for better element placement.

- **Implement Flexbox for Layout and Spacing**
  - Apply `display: flex` throughout your portfolio sections as needed (e.g., technologies section with technology images, portfolio cards, header, and footer).
  - Utilize flex properties (`justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-wrap`) for alignment and spacing.

- **Enhance User Experience with Pseudo-Classes**
  - Use `:hover` for interactive button and link effects.
  - Apply `:focus` to improve form input styling and accessibility.

### **Directions**

#### **Page Requirements (MVP)**

1. **Box Model Layout**:
   - Use margin, padding, borders, width, and height properties to structure your portfolio sections.
   - Ensure that sections such as `header`, `main`, and `footer` have proper spacing and alignment.

2. **Header Section (Navbar)**:
   - **Add a navigation bar** to your header section with links for **Home**, **About Me**, **Skills**, **Technologies**, and **Portfolio**.
   - Use `display: flex` to align and space the links horizontally.
   - Style the links (e.g., change the color, add hover effects).
   - Ensure the navbar is positioned at the top of the page.

3. **Flexbox Layout**:
   - Apply `display: flex` to at least the following sections of your portfolio:
     - **Technologies Section**: Display technology images in a row or grid layout (use `flex` to arrange images of technologies you know).
     - **Portfolio Cards**: Organize portfolio items (projects) using Flexbox for an easy-to-read layout.
     - **Header and Footer**: Apply Flexbox to position navigation links and content in the header and footer effectively.
   - Use flex properties (`justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-wrap`) to align and space elements.

4. **Positioning**:
   - Experiment with positioning techniques like `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky` to better place elements.
   - For example, use `position: fixed` for the navbar to remain visible on scroll.

5. **Pseudo-Classes**:
   - Use `:hover` for interactive buttons or links (e.g., change background color or underline text).
   - Apply `:focus` on form inputs (e.g., change border color or add a subtle shadow when the input is active).

---

#### **Stretch Requirements**

1. **Advanced Layout Techniques**:
   - Use `position: sticky` for a sticky footer or navbar that stays in view as you scroll.

2. **Advanced Interactivity**:
   - Add more complex pseudo-classes like `:active`, `:visited`, or `:focus-within` to further enhance user interaction.
   - Create a smooth hover effect on portfolio images or cards using CSS transitions.

### **Submission Guidelines**

1. **File Naming Convention**:  
   Save your HTML file as `lastname_firstname_portfolio.html` and your CSS file as `styles.css`.  
2. Place both files in a folder named `Lastname_Firstname_Portfolio_Enhancement` (e.g., `doe_john_portfolio_enhancement`).
3. Submit the entire folder via the designated platform or email it to your instructor with the subject line: "Portfolio Enhancement Assignment".

### **Important Notes**

- Test your work in a browser to ensure that it matches the expected layout and functionality.
- Use consistent indentation, comments, and formatting in your CSS code to make it readable and maintainable.
- Focus on applying the new CSS properties and interactivity to improve the design and user experience of your personal portfolio.
