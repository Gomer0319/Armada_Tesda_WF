   a) `float`  
   b) `z-index`  
   c) `position`  
   d) `display`  

3. **What is the default `display` property of a `<div>` element?**  
   a) Inline  
   b) Block  
   c) Inline-Block  
   d) None  

4. **When using `position: absolute;`, what is the element positioned relative to by default?**

   b) Inline  
   c) Inline-Block  
   d) Flex  

6. **What happens if you add padding and borders to an element without adjusting the width?**  
   a) The content size remains the same, but the total size of the element increases.  
   b) The content size decreases to fit the padding and borders.  
   c) Padding and borders are ignored unless explicitly set.  
   d) The total size remains unaffected.  

7. **Which positioning value removes an element entirely from the document flow?**  
   a) Static  
   b) Fixed  
   c) Absolute  
   d) Relative  

8. **What is the primary purpose of the `margin` in the Box Model?**

#### **Bonus Question (Extra)**  

10. **How does `position: fixed;` differ from `position: absolute;`?**  
    a) Fixed positioning uses the nearest positioned ancestor, while absolute uses the viewport.  
    b) Fixed positioning remains constant relative to the viewport, while absolute moves with the document flow.  
    c) Absolute positioning always depends on the parent, while fixed positioning ignores all ancestors.  
    d) Fixed positioning stays relative to the viewport, while absolute depends on the nearest ancestor with a position set.
