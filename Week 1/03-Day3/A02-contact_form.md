### **Directions**

#### **Page Requirements (MVP)**

1. **Document Setup:**
   - Save your file as `lastname_firstname_contactform.html`.
   - Include the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
   - Include a `<head>` section with a `<title>` tag reflecting the page content (e.g., "Contact Us Form").
   - Include a `<h1>` tag for the main heading (e.g., "Contact Us").

2. **Form Fields:**
   - **Name:** Create a text input field for the user’s name.
   - **Email:** Create an input field for the user’s email address. Use the `<input type="email">` tag.
   - **Message:** Add a text area (`<textarea>`) for the user to write their message.

3. **Submit Button:**
   - Add a submit button (`<button type="submit">`) to submit the form.

4. **Good Practices:**
   - Ensure all form elements are properly labeled using `<label>` tags.
   - Add the `required` attribute where necessary (for the name, email, and message fields).
   - Include comments (`<!-- -->`) to explain the purpose of key sections in your code.

> **Note:** Avoid using any inline styles or attributes related to appearance at this stage. Though it is not a good practice, we will allow the use of `<br>` tag to add line breaks so that you can visualize the form layout.
