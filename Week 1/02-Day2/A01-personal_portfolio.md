1. **Document Setup:**
   - Ensure your file is saved as `lastname_firstname_portfolio.html`.
   - Include the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the top.
   - Add a `<head>` section with a `<title>` tag (e.g., "My Personal Portfolio").
   
2. **Page Content:**
   - **Heading:** Use an `<h1>` tag for your main heading (e.g., "Welcome to My Personal Portfolio").
   - **Introduction:** Write a brief paragraph under the heading, introducing yourself (e.g., who you are, what you do, and your goals).
   - **Profile Image:** Add an image of yourself using the `<img>` tag. Ensure it includes an appropriate `alt` attribute (e.g., `alt="Profile photo of [Your Name]"`).
   - **List of Skills:** Use an unordered list (`<ul>`) to display 3-5 skills that you possess (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
   - **Technologies You're Learning:** Use an ordered list (`<ol>`) to show 3-5 technologies you're currently learning (e.g., React, Node.js, Bootstrap).
   - **Contact Information:** Create a table (`<table>`) to display at least 3 pieces of information (e.g., Email, Phone Number, LinkedIn Profile).

3. **Good Practices:**
   - Ensure your code is clean and well-indented.
   - Use semantic HTML where appropriate (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`).
   - Include comments (`<!-- -->`) to explain the purpose of key sections in your code.
