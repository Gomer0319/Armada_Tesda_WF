### **Directions**

#### **Page Requirements (MVP)**

1. **Document Setup:**
   - Ensure your file is saved as `lastname_firstname_favefood.html`.
   - Include the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
   - Add a proper `<head>` section containing a `<title>` tag. The title should reflect the content of your page (e.g., "My Favorite Food: Spaghetti Carbonara").

2. **Page Content:**
   - **Heading:** Use an `<h1>` tag for the title of your page (e.g., "My Favorite Food: Spaghetti Carbonara").
   - **Paragraph:** Write a short description of your favorite food under the heading (e.g., why you like it, its origin, or any interesting fact).
   - **Image:** Add an image of the food using the `<img>` tag. Ensure it includes an appropriate `alt` attribute (e.g., `alt="A plate of spaghetti carbonara"`).
   - **Ingredients:** Use an unordered list (`<ul>`) to display the ingredients required for the recipe.
   - **Instructions:** Use an ordered list (`<ol>`) to outline the steps to prepare the food.
   - **Nutritional Information:** Create a table (`<table>`) to display at least three nutritional facts (e.g., Calories, Protein, Fat).

3. **Good Practices:**
   - Ensure your code is clean and well-indented.
   - Use semantic HTML where appropriate.
   - Include comments (`<!-- -->`) to explain the purpose of key sections in your code.
