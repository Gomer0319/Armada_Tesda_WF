### **Assignment: Improving Your Personal Portfolio (HTML Only)**

This project allows you to improve the personal portfolio you created in **Assignment 1**. The focus is on enhancing the structure of your portfolio using **semantic HTML**, the **PCS relationship**, and **good coding practices**. In this assignment, you will also integrate a **contact form** and refine your HTML code for better accessibility and maintainability.

You are required to use the **Personal Portfolio** from **Assignment 1** as your base, and this project will build on that foundation.

### **Evaluation Criteria & Learning Objectives**

- **Enhance Your Portfolio with a Contact Form**  
  - Integrate a "Contact Me" section using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`.  
  - Ensure the form is user-friendly by using attributes like `placeholder` and `required`.

- **Apply Semantic HTML and the PCS Relationship**  
  - Structure the portfolio using appropriate semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.  
  - Organize your content according to the Parent-Child-Sibling (PCS) relationship to ensure a clear, logical hierarchy.

- **Validate and Debug HTML Code**  
  - Use the W3C Validator to check for any HTML errors and warnings.  
  - Correct any structural issues, improve indentation, and ensure clean, maintainable code.
