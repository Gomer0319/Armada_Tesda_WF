### **Instructions**

1. **Set Up the Project**  
   - Locate your original Personal Portfolio project folder.  
   - Create a copy of the folder and name it `lastname_firstname_finalportfolio`.  
   - Ensure the folder contains the following files:  
     - `index.html`  
     - `styles.css`  
     - `script.js`  
   - Link the CSS and JavaScript files to your HTML document.

2. **Enhance the Structure**  
   - Add the following sections to your portfolio:
     - **Home**: A welcome section with your name, title, and a brief description.
     - **About Me**: A section with your photo, description, skills, technologies, and certificates (if applicable).
     - **Portfolio**: A gallery or list of projects youâ€™ve worked on.
     - **Contact**: A section with a contact form and links to your social media or email.
   - Include a **navigation bar** with links to the above sections. Ensure that clicking on these links scrolls smoothly to the respective section on the page (research anchor links and smooth scrolling).

3. **Apply Responsive Design**  
   - Use **Flexbox**, **Bootstrap**, or **CSS Grid** to layout your content.
   - Apply **media queries** to make the design adaptable to different screen sizes.
   - Test the layout on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

4. **Add Interactivity with JavaScript**  
   - Implement at least one of the following features:
     - Smooth scrolling when navigation links are clicked.
     - A dynamic "back to top" button.
     - Interactive hover effects for portfolio items (e.g., display project details on hover).
     - A contact form with JavaScript validation.
   - Use **event listeners** and **DOM manipulation** to achieve the interactivity.

5. **Observe Good Practices**  
   - Use **semantic HTML** elements to structure your page (e.g., `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).  
   - Ensure the code follows the **PCS (Parent-Child-Sibling)** relationship.  
   - Comment your code for better readability.
