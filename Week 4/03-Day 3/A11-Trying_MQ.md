#### **Page Requirements (MVP)**

<img src="./Assets/Media_query_sample_output.gif" alt="Media Query sample output" width="80%">

1. **Basic Layout:**  
   - Create a container with four blocks arranged horizontally for larger screens.  
   - Each block should have distinct background colors and be evenly spaced.  

2. **Responsive Behavior:**  
   - On **phones**, the blocks should stack vertically, be smaller, and have lighter colors.  
   - On **tablets**, the blocks should be arranged in two rows and have medium colors and size.  
   - On **desktops**, the blocks should be larger and more vibrant in color.

3. **Smooth Transitions:**  
   - Use the `transition` property to add smooth resizing and color changes when the screen is resized.

#### **Stretch Requirements**

1. **Hover Effects:**  
   - Add hover effects to the blocks to change their color or scale slightly.  

2. **Flexbox or Grid:**  
   - Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to control the block layout. This will help you practice modern layout techniques.  

3. **Custom Breakpoints:**  
   - Experiment with adding an additional custom breakpoint (e.g., for extra-large screens).
