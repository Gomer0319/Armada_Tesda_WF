### **Week 3 Roadmap: JavaScript Essentials**  

#### **Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript**  
- Learn what JavaScript is and how to add it to HTML.  
- Explore variables: Declare, initialize, and reassign values.  
- Understand data types: Strings, numbers, booleans, null, and undefined.  
- Work with basic operators: Arithmetic, assignment, and comparison.  
- Knowledge Check

#### **Day 2: Control Structures**  
- **Conditional Statements:** Use `if`, `else`, and `else if` to make decisions in code.  
  - Explore the ternary operator (`condition ? value1 : value2`) for concise decision-making.  
- **Loops:** Learn `for` and `while` loops to repeat tasks efficiently.  
  - Understand loop control keywords like `break` and `continue`.  
- **Knowledge Check:** Solve logic problems like determining eligibility based on user input (conditionals) or iterating through arrays and patterns (loops).  

#### **Day 3: Functions and Events**  
- Learn how to create and call functions, understanding function syntax, parameters, and return values.  
- Discover how to use event listeners to add interactivity to buttons, forms, and other elements.  
- **Knowledge Check:** Write and debug event-driven scripts, such as making a button change text or toggling visibility on a webpage.  

#### **Day 4: DOM Manipulation**  
- Master accessing HTML elements using methods like `getElementById` and `querySelector`.  
- Modify content and attributes by updating text, adding/removing classes, and dynamically changing styles.  
- *(Extra)* Explore traversing the DOM to navigate parent, child, and sibling relationships.  
- **Knowledge Check:** Build a basic interactive page by manipulating elements dynamically.  

#### **Day 5: Mini Project 3**  
- Add interactivity to the Personal Portfolio webpage using JavaScript.  
- Focus on tasks like toggling themes, creating dropdown menus, or adding dynamic forms.  
- **Peer Review and Feedback:** Share your work with a peer, provide constructive feedback, and refine your project.

### **Learning Objectives**  
By the end of Week 3, trainees will be able to:  
1. Write and integrate JavaScript code into HTML documents.  
2. Use variables, data types, and operators effectively in scripts.  
3. Implement conditional statements, including ternary operators, to guide program flow.  
4. Use loops to efficiently perform repetitive tasks.  
5. Create reusable functions and handle user events with event listeners.  
6. Access and manipulate the DOM to dynamically update webpage content.  
7. Apply interactivity to web projects using JavaScript.  
8. Collaborate with peers to review and enhance coding skills.
