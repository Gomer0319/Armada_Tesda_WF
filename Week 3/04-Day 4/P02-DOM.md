### **Practice Assignment: Exploring the DOM - Manipulation and Traversing**

In this assignment, youâ€™ll focus on fundamental DOM manipulation and traversing techniques using JavaScript. You will dynamically create, modify, and traverse DOM elements, reinforcing your understanding of the DOM and its practical applications.

#### **Estimated Time to Completion:** 30-45 minutes
#### **Level of Complexity:** Beginner

---

### **Instructions**

1. **Setup**:
   - Create a new HTML file (`index.html`) and a JavaScript file (`script.js`).
   - Link the JavaScript file to the HTML document.

2. **Tasks**:

   **Task 1: Create and Append Elements**
   - Create a `<div>` element dynamically using JavaScript.
   - Append it as a child to an existing `<div>` with `id="container"` in your HTML.

   **Task 2: Modify Element Content**
   - Select the `<div>` you just appended.
   - Change its text content to "Hello, DOM!".

   **Task 3: Style Modification**
   - Change the background color of the `<div>` you created to `lightblue`.
   - Set its width to `200px` and height to `100px`.
   - Add a border with `1px solid gray`.

   **Task 4: DOM Traversal and Modification**
   - Create a list (`<ul>`) dynamically with three list items (`<li>`), each containing different text (e.g., "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3").
   - Append this list to the existing `<div>` with `id="container"`.

   **Task 5: Event Handling**
   - Add a click event listener to each `<li>` in the list.
   - When clicked, change the text color of the clicked `<li>` to `red`.

### **Evaluation Criteria & Learning Objectives**

- Demonstrate understanding of basic DOM manipulation techniques.
- Correctly apply methods to create, modify, and traverse DOM elements.
- Implement event handling to respond to user interactions.
- Practice using JavaScript to enhance interactivity and visual presentation on webpages.

### **Directions**

#### **Page Requirements (MVP)**

1. **Setup and File Linking:**
   - Ensure your `index.html` links to the `script.js` file.

2. **Container Setup:**
   - Use the following HTML structure as your starting point:

     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>DOM Practice</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <div id="container">
             <!-- Dynamic content will be added here -->
         </div>
         <script src="script.js"></script>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

3. **DOM Manipulation Tasks:**
   - Complete all five tasks listed above.

4. **File Setup:**
   - Save your JavaScript file as `script.js`.

#### **Stretch Goals**

1. Add a button below the list (`<ul>`) that says "Reset Colors".
   - When clicked, it should reset the text color of all `<li>` elements back to black.

2. Add a new `<li>` dynamically to the list each time a button labeled "Add Item" is clicked.
   - The new `<li>` should contain the text "New Item" followed by the current count of items (e.g., "New Item 4").

### **Submission Guidelines**

1. Save your completed `index.html` and `script.js` files.
2. Submit these files via the designated platform or email them to your instructor with the subject line: "Practice Assignment: Exploring the DOM".

### **Important Notes**

- Focus on using basic DOM manipulation methods like `document.createElement`, `appendChild`, and `addEventListener`.
- Avoid adding unnecessary elements or unrelated features to the provided HTML structure.
- Include comments in your JavaScript file to explain your code logic.
