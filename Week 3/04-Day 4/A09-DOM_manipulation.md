### **Assignment 6: Enhancing Your Portfolio with Basic JavaScript**  

In this assignment, you will practice **basic DOM manipulation** and **traversal techniques** by making small interactive updates to your **Personal Portfolio** using JavaScript. This will help you get comfortable selecting and modifying elements without adding complex interactivity.  

#### **Estimated Time to Completion:** 2–4 hours  
#### **Level of Complexity:** Beginner  

---

### **Instructions**  

1. Use your **Personal Portfolio** from previous assignments as the base.  
2. Create a new JavaScript file (`script.js`) and link it to your portfolio.  
3. Apply **basic JavaScript enhancements** to modify content and interact with elements.

### **Evaluation Criteria & Learning Objectives**  

By completing this assignment, you will:  

- **Select and Modify HTML Elements Using JavaScript**  
  - Use `getElementById()` and `querySelector()` to select elements.  
  - Change text content and styles dynamically.  

- **Traverse the DOM to Access Parent, Child, and Sibling Elements**  
  - Use properties like `parentNode` and `children` to navigate the DOM.  
  - Apply changes to multiple elements using `querySelectorAll()` and loops.

### **Directions**  

#### **Page Requirements (MVP)**  

1. **Modify Header Content Dynamically**  
   - Select the **main heading** (your name/title) and change its color using JavaScript.  
   - Update the **navigation links** by adding a background color when hovered over.  

2. **Update the About Section with JavaScript**  
   - Select the **About Me** paragraph and change its content using JavaScript.  
   - Add a button labeled **"Update Bio"** that updates the text when clicked.  

3. **Highlight Technologies with JavaScript**  
   - Select all technology images in the **Technologies Section** using `querySelectorAll()`.  
   - Loop through them and add a simple **border effect** when hovered over (`onmouseover`).

#### **Stretch Goals (Optional, for those who want a challenge)**  

1. **Interactive Theme Toggle**  
   - Add a **"Toggle Theme"** button that changes the page’s background color between light and dark modes.  

2. **Welcome Message Based on Time**  
   - Display a JavaScript-powered **greeting** ("Good morning!" or "Good evening!") based on the user’s time.

### **Submission Guidelines**  

1. **File Naming Convention**:  
   - Save your JavaScript file as `script.js` and ensure it is properly linked.  

2. **Submission Format**:  
   - Submit a zipped folder named `Lastname_Firstname_Portfolio_DOM`.  
   - Include screenshots showing the JavaScript updates in action.  

3. **Submission Method**:  
   - Upload to the designated platform or email it to your instructor with the subject line: **"Portfolio DOM Manipulation Assignment"**.

### **Important Notes**  

- Keep your **JavaScript code simple** and **well-commented** to explain your logic.  
- Ensure your updates work without breaking the existing layout.  
- Test your updates in a browser before submission.
