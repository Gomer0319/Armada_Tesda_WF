### Assignment 9: Practicing DOM Manipulation and Traversing in your Portfolio

This assignment will introduce you to DOM manipulation and traversal by making simple modifications to their **Personal Portfolio** using JavaScript. The goal is to help you practice selecting, modifying, and traversing elements in the DOM without adding complex interactivity.

#### Estimated Time to Completion
**2–4 hours**

#### Level of Complexity
**Beginner**

---
#### Instructions

1. Use your **Personal Portfolio** from previous assignments as the base.
2. Create a new JavaScript file (`script.js`) and link it to your portfolio.
3. Apply **basic JavaScript enhancements** to modify content and interact with elements.

#### Evaluation Criteria and Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, trainees will be able to:
- Select and Modify HTML Elements Using JavaScript
- Traverse the DOM to Access Parent, Child, and Sibling Elements
- Demonstrate ability to select, modify, and traverse DOM elements.
- Apply JavaScript techniques to enhance portfolio content.

#### Directions

#### ***Page Requirements (MVP)***

1. **Modify Header Content Dynamically**
   - Select the **main heading** (your name/title) and change its color using JavaScript.
   - Update the **navigation links** by adding a background color when hovered over.

2. **Update the About Section with JavaScript**
   - Select the **About Me** section and change its content using JavaScript.
   - Add a button labeled **"Update Bio"** that updates the text when clicked.

3. **Highlight Technologies with JavaScript**
   - Select all technology images in the **Technologies Section** using `querySelectorAll()`.
   - Loop through them and add a simple **border effect** when hovered over (`onmouseover`).


#### **Stretch Goals (Optional, for those who want a challenge)**

1. **Interactive Theme Toggle**
   - Add a **"Toggle Theme"** button that changes the page’s background color between light and dark modes.

2. **Welcome Message Based on Time**
   - Display a JavaScript-powered **greeting** ("Good morning!" or "Good evening!") based on the user’s time.

#### Submission Guidelines

1. **File Naming Convention:**
   - Save your JavaScript file as `script.js` and ensure it is properly linked.

2. **Submission Format:**
   - Submit a zipped folder named `Lastname_Firstname_Portfolio_DOM`.
   - Include screenshots showing the JavaScript updates in action.

3. **Submission Method:**
   - Upload to the designated platform or email it to your instructor with the subject line: **"Portfolio DOM Manipulation Assignment"**.
