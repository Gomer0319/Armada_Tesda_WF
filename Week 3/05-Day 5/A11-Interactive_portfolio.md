### **Assignment 11: Adding JavaScript Functionality to Your Personal Portfolio**  

In this assignment, you will further enhance your **Personal Portfolio** by applying JavaScript concepts, focusing on event handling, DOM manipulation, form validation, and loops. You will implement interactive features to improve user experience and reinforce your JavaScript skills.  

#### **Estimated Time to Completion:** 3–5 hours  
#### **Level of Complexity:** Intermediate  

---  

### **Instructions**  

1. **Base Assignment**: Use the **Personal Portfolio** from **Assignment 7** as your base.
2. **Create or Update JavaScript File**: Update `script.js` or create a new file and link it to your portfolio.
3. **Apply JavaScript Enhancements**: Implement the following interactive features as detailed in the requirements.

### **Evaluation Criteria & Learning Objectives**  

By completing this assignment, trainees will be able to:  

- **Implement an Image Slideshow Using JavaScript**  
  - Store and cycle through multiple profile images when the "Next" or "Previous" button is clicked.  
  - Use variables to track the current image index.  
  - Apply event listeners and conditional statements to update the displayed image dynamically.  

- **Create a Functional "Back to Top" Button**  
  - Use JavaScript to detect scrolling and show the button when necessary.  
  - Implement smooth scrolling when the button is clicked.  

- **Validate Form Input Before Submission**  
  - Ensure required fields (e.g., name, email, message) are filled.  
  - Use conditional statements to check email format and display validation messages.  

- **Dynamically Display Technologies Using Loops**  
  - Store a list of technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery) in an array.  
  - Use a loop to generate and display images for each technology dynamically.  
  - Append these images to a dedicated "Technologies" section.

### **Directions**  

#### **Page Requirements (MVP)**  

1. **Image switcherfor Profile Picture**  
   - Add at least **three images** to your profile section.  
   - Create **Next** and **Previous** buttons to cycle through images.  
   - Use JavaScript to change the displayed image when buttons are clicked.  

2. **Back to Top Button**  
   - Add a **"Back to Top"** button that appears when the user scrolls down.  
   - Implement smooth scrolling to return to the top of the page when clicked.  

3. **Form Validation**  
   - Validate the **contact form** before submission.  
   - Ensure fields (name, email, message) are not empty.  
   - Display an error message if the email format is incorrect.  

4. **Dynamically Display Technologies Using Loops**  
   - Store a list of technologies in an array (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.).  
   - Use JavaScript to generate and display each technology as an image dynamically.  
   - Append the images to the "Technologies" section.

#### **Stretch Goals (Optional, for those who want a challenge)**  

1. **Auto-Slideshow for Profile Picture**  
   - Set a timer to automatically cycle through images every 3 seconds.  

2. **Enhanced Form Validation with Regex**  
   - Use Regular Expressions (Regex) to ensure email validation is strict.  

3. **Animated "Back to Top" Button**  
   - Add a fade-in/out effect for when the button appears or disappears.  

4. **Store User Preferences (Theme Mode)**  
   - Implement a **dark mode toggle** and store the user’s choice using `localStorage`.

### **Submission Guidelines**  

1. **File Naming Convention**:  
   - Save your JavaScript file as `script.js` and ensure it is properly linked.  

2. **Submission Format**:  
   - Submit a zipped folder named `Lastname_Firstname_Portfolio_JSEnhancements`.  
   - Include screenshots showing the JavaScript updates in action.  

3. **Submission Method**:  
   - Upload to the designated platform or email it to your instructor with the subject line: **"Portfolio JavaScript Enhancements Assignment"**.

### **Important Notes**  

- Keep your **JavaScript code clean and well-commented** to explain your logic.  
- Ensure your updates work without breaking the existing layout.  
- Test your updates in a browser before submission.
