### **Project: Interactive Quiz Webpage**  

The goal is to create an interactive quiz webpage that uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project focuses on applying JavaScript concepts such as:  
- Variables and operators.  
- Conditional statements (if-else and switch).  
- Loops.  
- Event listeners.  
- DOM manipulation.  

You will build a simple webpage where users can answer a series of quiz questions and receive feedback on their performance.

### **Instructions**  

1. **Set Up the Project**  
   - Create a folder named `lastname_firstname_quizproject`.  
   - Inside the folder, create the following files:  
     - `index.html`  
     - `styles.css`  
     - `script.js`  
   - Link the CSS and JavaScript files to your HTML document.  

2. **Structure the Webpage**  
   - Use semantic HTML to create the following sections:  
     - **Header**: Title of the quiz.  
     - **Main Content**:  
       - A section for quiz questions (at least 5).  
       - A "Submit" button.  
       - A feedback area to show results after submission.  
     - **Footer**: A message like “Good luck!” or credits.  

3. **Design the Page with CSS**  
   - Add styles to make the quiz visually appealing.  
   - Use the **Box Model** for spacing.  
   - Use **Flexbox** for alignment.  

4. **Add JavaScript Functionality**  
   - Use JavaScript to:  
     - Store the quiz questions, answers, and user responses.  
     - Validate user input.  
     - Display the quiz results dynamically.  
   - Emphasize the use of:  
     - Variables and operators to handle quiz logic.  
     - Conditional statements to check answers.  
     - Loops for processing multiple questions.  
     - Event listeners for button clicks.  
     - DOM manipulation to update the quiz result area.

### **Requirements (MVP)**  

1. **Basic Layout**  
   - A title, a set of 5 questions, and a results section.  
   - Each question should have 3-4 multiple-choice options (radio buttons).  

2. **JavaScript Logic**  
   - Validate the answers when the user clicks “Submit.”  
   - Display the total score and feedback dynamically on the webpage.  
   - Use at least one loop, conditional statement, and event listener.  

3. **Good Practices**  
   - Use meaningful variable names and comments in your JavaScript code.  
   - Write clean and readable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### **Stretch Goals**  

1. **Timer**  
   - Add a countdown timer for the quiz.

2. **Animations**  
   - Use CSS to add hover effects and transitions to buttons or quiz sections.  

3. **More Questions**  
   - Extend the quiz to include 10 or more questions.  

4. **Score Breakdown**  
   - Display detailed feedback, such as which questions were correct and incorrect.
