### **Knowledge Check: Conditional Statements and Loops**  

#### **Instructions:**  
Read each scenario carefully and write the JavaScript code that solves the problem.

### **1. Conditional Logic: Deciding What to Wear**  
You want to create a program that helps decide what to wear based on the weather:  
- If it's sunny, suggest wearing sunglasses.  
- If it's rainy, suggest carrying an umbrella.  
- If it's snowing, suggest wearing a coat.  
- If the weather is unknown, suggest staying prepared for anything.  

Write the code to implement this logic using conditional statements (`if-else`).

### **2. Loops: Counting Even Numbers**  
Write a loop that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20. Use the `continue` keyword to skip odd numbers.  

---

### **3. Combining Conditional Statements and Loops: Finding a Specific Value**  
You have an array of numbers: `[3, 7, 12, 19, 21, 24]`.  
Write a program to loop through the array and find the first number greater than 20. Once found, print the number and stop the loop using the `break` keyword.

### **4. Ternary Operator: Simplifying Choices**  
A program needs to display a message based on whether a user is logged in or not.  
- If the user is logged in (`loggedIn = true`), display "Welcome back!".  
- If not, display "Please log in.".  

Write the solution using the ternary operator.

### **5. Deciding the Right Loop**  
You have an array of tasks:  
```javascript
let tasks = ["Buy groceries", "Clean the house", "Pay bills", "Call mom"];
```  
Choose the most appropriate loop to:  
1. Print each task.  
2. Stop printing if the task is "Pay bills".  

Explain your choice of loop and write the corresponding JavaScript code.

#### **Goal:**  
These problems are designed to assess understanding of when and how to use conditional statements, loops, and control keywords effectively. Review the solutions to ensure the correct approach and syntax are applied.
