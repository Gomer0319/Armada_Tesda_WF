### **Assignment: Translate Pseudocode to JavaScript**  

Your task is to practice applying conditional statements and loops by translating a given pseudocode into JavaScript. This assignment focuses on logical thinking, understanding loops, and using conditionals effectively.  

#### **Estimated Time to Completion:** 30â€“45 minutes  
#### **Level of Complexity:** Beginner  

---

### **Instructions**  

1. Review the pseudocode provided below.  
2. Write a JavaScript program that follows the logic described in the pseudocode.  
3. Use only the concepts covered so far (conditional statements, loops, arrays).  
4. Test your code to ensure it produces the correct output.  
5. You can use [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) to check and run your program.

#### **Pseudocode**  

1. Initialize an array called `scores` with the following values: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88]`.  
2. Initialize a variable called `totalScore` and set it to 0.  
3. Repeat the following for each score in the `scores` array:  
   - If the score is greater than or equal to 80, add it to `totalScore`.  
   - Otherwise, skip to the next score.  
4. After processing all scores, check the `totalScore`:  
   - If `totalScore` is greater than or equal to 400, display: "Congratulations! High score achieved!"  
   - Otherwise, display: "Try again to achieve a higher score."

### **Evaluation Criteria & Learning Objectives**  

#### **Learning Objectives:**  
- Demonstrate the ability to translate pseudocode into JavaScript.  
- Practice using conditional statements and loops effectively.  
- Debug and test JavaScript programs using tools like JSBin.  

#### **Evaluation Criteria:**  
1. **Correct Implementation:** The program follows the pseudocode logic accurately.  
2. **Accuracy:** The program calculates the `totalScore` correctly and displays the appropriate message.  
3. **Readability:** The code is clean, well-indented, and includes meaningful comments.

### **Directions**  

#### **Assignment Requirements (MVP)**  

1. Translate the pseudocode into JavaScript using:  
   - A loop to iterate through the `scores` array.  
   - A conditional statement to check if the score meets the criteria.  

2. Your program should output either:  
   - `"Congratulations! High score achieved!"`  
   - `"Try again to achieve a higher score."`  

#### **Stretch Requirements:**  
- Add a feature to calculate and display the **average score**.  
- Modify the output to include both the total and average scores.

### **Submission Guidelines**  

1. Save your program in a file named:  
   **lastname_firstname_translate.js**  
   (e.g., **smith_john_translate.js**).  
2. Submit the `.js` file via the designated platform or email it to your instructor with the subject line:  
   **"Pseudocode Translation Assignment Submission."**

### **Important Notes**  

- Focus on writing clean, functional code.  
- Use `console.log()` to display intermediate results if needed.  
- Stick to the basics covered so far and avoid using advanced JavaScript features.
